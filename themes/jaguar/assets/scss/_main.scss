/*
Browsers don't directly understand SCSS. You will have to compile it to a
regular CSS file first. You may want to learn about regular old CSS before
going through this process, heh ^^'

You will need to install Dart SASS (from https://sass-lang.com/install/). I went
with Install Anywhere (Standalone) myself.

Then navigate to this directory (scss) and enter the following from within
the command line or terminal:

sass -w _main.scss ../css/scss_style.css

This will compile the file to 'css/scss_style.css' and watch for any changes.
Press CTRL + C to end the application.
